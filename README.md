## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify these images with high accuracy.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to clone the repository and set up your environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vladstelmakh/CIFAR10Vision.git
cd CIFAR10Vision

Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:

TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used in this project is as follows:

Convolutional Layer 1: 32 filters, kernel size (3x3), ReLU activation
MaxPooling Layer 1: Pool size (2x2)
Convolutional Layer 2: 64 filters, kernel size (3x3), ReLU activation
MaxPooling Layer 2: Pool size (2x2)
Convolutional Layer 3: 128 filters, kernel size (3x3), ReLU activation
MaxPooling Layer 3: Pool size (2x2)
Flatten Layer
Fully Connected Layer 1: 512 units, ReLU activation
Fully Connected Layer 2: 10 units, Softmax activation

Training
To train the model, run the train.py script:
The script will:

Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Preprocess the data.
Build and compile the CNN model.
Train the model for 10 epochs.
Save the trained model.


Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model, use the evaluate.py script:
python evaluate.py
This script will:

Load the trained model.
Evaluate its performance on the test dataset.
Print out accuracy and loss metrics.


Usage
Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new images. For example, to classify a new image, use the predict.py script:
python predict.py --image_path path/to/your/image.png
Replace path/to/your/image.png with the path to the image you want to classify.
